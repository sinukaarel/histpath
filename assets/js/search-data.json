            "content": "Cell detection and classification . Task . Physicians can identify men’s infertility by counting specific cells in testis histopathology images. Such annotation is hard manual labor that can be automated using neural networks. Ida-Tallinn hospital provided a large dataset of these images to build a cell detector and classifier to ease specialists’ lives. . Data and MIRAX format . Data comes in MIRAX format - a special kind of virtual slide format. Virtual slide is a high-resolution digital image of the microscopy sample that is created by sliding the glass past the camera and taking multiple pictures. . These created images are too high-resolution to practically handle as image tiles and are broken up into multiple files. This kind of processing needs special notation and a system in order to view and access data after storage. . On disk the format includes: . .mrxs file that holds the metadata including information on how .dat files are organized | data folder with .dat files that hold the actual image data | Index.dat file in data folder that holds the pointers to locate the image data | .json annotation file in JSON format that holds the metadata for the annotated section of the image | Slidedat.ini file in data folder that contains structural data and parameters of the scanning process in key=value format. These values are also used in order to receive image data. . TODO: - image thumbnails - image parameters (size, etc) - annotations and overview . | . Downscaling images . As the whole-slide images are too big to process it is required to downscale the whole image into smaller tiles. . Resources: . Downscaling whole-slide images in Python link | Use tiling and generate smaller images where the sample occupying atleast 90% of the area link | Deephistopath link | .",
